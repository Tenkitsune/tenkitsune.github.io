      <p class="lead fontent">Thank you very much for taking the time to visit our website! We are excited to have the opportunity to share this wonderful life event with our friends and family. Please feel free to read about our story and all about the events for our big day. You can also read about some other information you can use to help you plan for your visit with us on this day. <br /><br />
          During our journey on finding the perfect venue, we decided that the Ozarks would be the perfect place with its beautiful scenery and homey feel. And so, our celebration will be taking place at the beautifully scenic Big Cedar Lodge in Ridgedale, Missouri on November 3rd, 2018. Please know that this is a resort-style location, so in additional to the chapel and reception hall, there will be additional services and accommodation options available on-site. We do hope that you choose to join us in this joyful celebration!<br /><br />
          For your reference, the resort is about 15 minutes south of Branson, MO, or about 3 hours and 40 minutes southwest of St. Louis.<br /><br />
      <h2 class="text-center">About RSVP</h2><br /><br />
      <p class="lead fontent">Please also note that once the invitations are sent out, we will be offering you the option to RSVP right here on this page! So, be sure to check back on this site when you receive your invitation sometime in late August if you would like to respond online. You will still have the option to RSVP through regular post mail, so feel free to respond in whichever way you choose!

          <div class="modal-body">
              <p>I'd like to give you a warning up front that this is about to get extremely mushy. If you are not willing or prepared to read an excruciatingly sentimental love story, please stop here, because this synopsis has been cooked down to a mash of applesauce. Really. But, instead of me sitting here telling you just how sappy this story is, allow me to just tell you the story itself, and about how these two cool cats fell deeply in love. It's Jon and I, in case that wasn't made clear yet by this whole thing.<br /><br />

                  When I met Jon for the first time, I quickly found that he and I had very similar interests, including a rare interest for a video game called “Phantasy Star Online 2”. For those who may be unaware, this video game was never released in the United States, so you can imagine my surprise when I find that one of my coworkers has also played this game. From there, we started to build a friendship upon other interests. We started to hang out more often, but of course it didn't stop there.<br /><br />
                  
                  Our engagement story starts with a walk through a park in Chicago. He knows how much I love birds, especially waterfowl. So, naturally, he took me to the spot where there we plenty of birds to be seen. There, we saw many different kinds of ducks, geese, and swans. In particular, there was a beautiful swan couple enjoying a beautiful spring day, just as we were. Jon told me that they were love birds, just as we were. He then presented me with the most beautiful ring that I (unknowingly) picked out during our trips to several jewelry stores in the weeks prior. It was the most wonderful moment of realization I have ever had, and I am so happy it brought us to where we are today.<br /><br />
                  
                  I have never met someone quite like him. Someone who loves as unconditionally as he does. He works along side me to help make me a better person, and I truly hope I have been able to do the same for him. He is my rock: a real foundation in my life that I can truly lean on. I'm also lucky to have met someone with such an amazing family, too. It has been one of the kindest, most welcoming families I have ever met, and for that I am truly grateful.<br /><br />
                  
                  I am so happy to be able to share my life with his, and now with you as you are reading about our journey. I know that our future together may not be the easiest path, but it certainly will be a path worth taking. I know that he and I will continue to work together to improve ourselves as individuals and as a couple.<br /><br />
                  
                  And so, perhaps, when a girl from Arkansas and guy from northwest Indiana meet for the first time in Connecticut and share such a rare interest, then a great relationship, at the very least, seems to be appropriate, and perhaps even destiny.<br /><br /><br /><br />
                  
                  Also, I'll try my best to get him to be better at video games. Cus like, I'm better than he is.</p>

              <p>Hmmm what to say as the Heather has summed up how we met and how I proposed… Its really funny how life throws you something when you never expect it. When I first met Heather I never thought that we would ever be any more than friends. However slowly over time as we became better friends did I start who she really is. For instance, have you ever seen Heather when there are a flock of geese? She will proceed to put her hands over her mouth and jump up and down in glee. How about how she goes out of her way for any person she sees is in need. Or did you know she is extremely shy to the point where she is afraid to talk to people. Despite this she gives it her all to try to better herself and grow to be a better person. I have grown to see this intelligent, beautiful, shy, and caring woman and slowly over time realized that I had fallen in love with her. Looking back over the last two years, I am extremely happy that our paths crossed and can wait to journey together for the rest of eternity.</p>
